A first goal for 18-year-old Alejandro Garnacho was enough to defeat Real Sociedad but was not enough to progress as winners of the group, 
so Erik ten Hag’s team will be thrown into a playoff against one of those “failed sharks” from the Champions League:
one of Ajax, Barcelona, Juventus, Leverkusen, Salzburg, Sevilla, Shakhtar or Sporting CP will have to be overcome to continue in
this competition. That may not be too terrifying but it was not the way United wanted it. Two more games in the spring are not
what they wanted either. Garnacho’s superb strike after quarter of an hour of his second start had briefly given them hope of
avoiding that but United needed another goal.Although they might have got it when Cristiano Ronaldo ran clean through in the first
half only to pass up the best chance and, while Ten Hag pointed to opportunities for Bruno Fernandes and Garnacho, they did not
force a save from the Real Sociedad keeper, Álex Remiro.The excitement of seeing the teenager apart – “I hope Garnacho can keep
the attitude that he has now: he can create, he can give the final pass and he can score goals so I am happy with his process,”
Ten Hag said – not enough really happened for United, bar a couple of superb passes from Fernandes.They ended the match with
centre-back Harry Maguire up front. The objective was clear; the route there, a little less so.The good news is that this was
still victory and the damage done may yet be relative. “Of course we are disappointed not to win with two goals difference but in
the end we won the game, we kept a clean sheet, we create some good chances: there are positives to take back to Manchester,” the
manager said afterwards.
